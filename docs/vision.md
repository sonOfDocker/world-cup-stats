# Vision

World Cup Stats is an end-to-end data systems project built around
international football tournaments, starting with the FIFA World Cup.

The goal is not just statistical analysis, but deliberate system design:
- raw data ingestion
- normalization and modeling
- repeatable pipelines
- clear analytical outputs

Technology choices are intentionally deferred until the data and
workflows are well understood.
