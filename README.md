# World Cup Stats

This project exists to combine two of my passions: football (soccer) and
designing data systems end to end — from raw data ingestion to analysis
and visualization.

The initial focus is on FIFA World Cup data as a concrete dataset for
exploring data modeling, ingestion pipelines, and analytics workflows.
